            <h2 class="post-title">Subject matter and theme</h2>
            <p class="post-content">
                We aim for an entertaining and interesting website. The first step we had quite difficult in choosing
                the theme and colors for the website.
                After a while of discussion, we finally chose the Marvel theme because everyone in our group liked
                Marvel Studio.
                We choose colors with deep tones and depth. This makes our website more beautiful and eye-catching.
                About the layout, we decided to show all the content in order from top to bottom to make the viewer feel
                comfortable and easy to observe.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-section" id="blog-2">
            <h2 class="post-title">Groupâ€™s password policy</h2>
            <p class="post-content">
            <p>For our group password policy, we decide to implement a policy where the minimium
                characters requirement is 5 with the combination of at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase,
                and 1 number digit. This can be further complicated if adding special symbols to our policy
                by adding it to the testing library of the password. However, since the website is in
                prototype phrase, we decided to use that above combination for the purpose of testing before making it
                more complex for password security reason. </p><br>

            <p>The validation field function js file for the login page and registration page is separated
                from the rest of the pages in order to minimise conflict between the execution of codes
                from the rest of the pages in order to minimise conflict between the execution of codes. Within the
                registration.js file, function to reset the form, validating is implemented where there are event
                listener to run the function when buttons are clicked by the users. Within the validation function,
                there should
                be a series of if-else statement for validating each input. Validating against the password policy
                locates at the end after
                comfirm password and password is validated to not be empty and to be identical to each other. Then the
                password is examined
                by the policy, if not satified, red background of the input field will appear with an error message to
                depict that the password does not satisfy the password policy. </p><br>

            <p>The value of the password is accessed using DOM, then it is tested using the test() function against
                passPolicy = /^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\d)[0-9a-zA-Z]{5,}$/. The test() function will return true or
                false (true for
                meeting the requirement and vice versa). The result of the test function is stored in a new variable.
                When the last validation
                steps occures, if false is passed in to the if-statement, then the error message will be displayed,
                otherwise it
                meets the requirment and return back to home page. </p>

        <div class="content-section" id="blog-3">
            <h2 class="post-title">Handle new user registration</h2>
            <p class="post-content">
                We decided to redirect the user to the register page instead of doing this dynamically. The user can
                access the
                registration page by click on the navigation section bar, footer, or through a button on the login page
                if they are not registered.

                The reason for this method is due to ease of implementing the the html and js files for login and
                register page. Although similar implementation
                code is applied, separating the code for both make it better for debugging and implementing.

                If doing this dynamically, it would create a complicated login/register page where in the event of
                unessary error occur, it would complicate the
                debug process. In addition, having a register page locate somewhere visually allow the user to go direct
                to that page if they are new, hence,
                improving their experience of using the page instead of having go to the login page to find the register
                function.

            <h2 class="post-title">The embellishment/s our group incorporated beyond the core specifications</h2>

            <p class="post-content">

                <br>
                - Sticky navigation bar: <br>
                Website navigation allows visitors to quickly and easily find the information they are looking for (like
                registering or logging in to create a new blog post). In addition, it also displays to help users know
                which page they are on on the website. First, to create the navbar, we create the HTML file for it (put
                all the page titles in a list with the same class name, this makes it easier to style it in CSS). Then
                we format the headers and set them to the "display: flex" attribute, which always makes the navigation
                bar appear at the top of the page.
                <br>
                - The slideshow: <br>
                Slideshow helps us show photos or links to the most featured (or latest) blog posts, helping to attract
                attention when users visit the blog for the first time. We first added the images to the HTML file,
                adjusted the CSS property not to show them, and then used JS to display each image (depending on whether
                the user pressed the back or continue button).
                <br>
                - The fade effect: <br>
                The fade effect can make the website content displayed to the user smoother, not rigid. We've written
                the content on HTML files before with classes/ID names that are consistent for each of their functions,
                so it's easy to tweak the CSS properties for all the content. In addition, this has support for the JS
                side. Based on the mouse scroll's coordinates, the content will be slowly displayed.
                <br>
                - The toTop button: <br>
                This button allows visitors to return to the top of the page without scrolling too much. We use
                window.pageYOffset to determine the coordinates of the mouse wheel the user is in from the window's
                upper. The button will be displayed from there, and the user can interact with it.
